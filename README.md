## Objective

Build a CLI to charge people money, 

To make this interesting, I'm gonna make it REAL and use a real payment processing service (Stripe). But that means a bit of hand waving and extra context / explanation will be required. 

In the process try and cover the following:

1. Constants in Ruby
2. Namespacing (again)
3. Custom Exceptions
4. Stubbing and Mocking in RSpec (common use case)
